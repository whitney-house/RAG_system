# Recipe RAG System  
Inspired by course: [Understanding LLMs](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/intro.html)  

## Project Overview  
This project is a cutting-edge **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for **recipe retrieval** and **context-aware response generation**.  
It integrates **Llama** as the core language model, **MiniLM embeddings** for efficient retrieval, and **FAISS** for vector search, all exposed through a high-performance **FastAPI server**.
