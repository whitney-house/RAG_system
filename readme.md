# ChatBot with RAG 
Inspired by course: [Understanding LLMs](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/intro.html)  

## Project Overview  

This project is a **ChatBot based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for **recipe retrieval** and **context-aware response generation**.  
It integrates **Llama** as the core language model, **MiniLM embeddings** for efficient retrieval, and **FAISS** for vector search, all exposed through **React & FastAPI server**.  


## Demo Preview  
Below are sample screenshots showcasing the system in action. The images are stored in the `assets/` folder:
